### Notes for Future Maintainers

The provenance information (where it came from and which commit) is stored in the file `cgmanifest.json` in the same directory as this readme.
Please update the provenance information in that file when ingesting an updated version of the dependent library.
That provenance file is automatically read and inventoried by Microsoft systems to ensure compliance with appropiate governance standards.
